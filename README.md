# High-Performance Code Generation: Python to C++ Translation

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to convert Python code into high-performance C++ code using AI models (GPT and Claude). The C++ code generated performs identical tasks to the Python code but with enhanced execution speed.

## Example 1: Pi Calculation
The following Python code calculates Pi using a series expansion. The Python code is optimized for time performance.

## Example 2:  Further Calculation and Optimization
In this example, we calculate a more complex mathematical expression using a similar series-based approach but with enhanced parameters for greater accuracy and optimization.

## Installation
To compile and run the C++ code, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Clang). You can compile the program using the following command:

## Performance Comparison
The C++ version, despite being computationally intensive, achieves significant performance gains. The Python version may run slower due to higher-level abstractions, while the C++ version optimizes for raw performance.
